/* 
A Set is a collection of unique elements that can be of any type. 
Set is also an ordered collection of elements, 
which means that elements will be retrieved in the same order that they were inserted in.

A Set in JavaScript behaves the same way as a mathematical set. 

JavaScript sets resemble arrays in the sense that they are also collections of values. 
But, unlike arrays, these data collections can only include unique values. 
In other words, you canâ€™t have duplicates in a set.

The second difference between arrays and sets is that inside sets, 
the values are stored in no particular order, 
so you can just call them by their name.

//initialisation
const set = new Set();

//adding elements
set.add("Ajay"); //adds "Ajay"
set.add(23); //adds 23
set.add(false); //adds false
set.add("Ghimire");
set.add(100.1);

let obj = { type: "Person" };
set.add(obj);
console.log(set);

//checking size
console.log(set.size);

//searching and checking if the element exists
console.log(set.has(23)); //true

//removing an element
set.delete(false); //removes falses from the set
console.log(set);

/* How to Iterate Over a Set in JavaScript
Set has a method called values() 
which returns a SetIterator to get all its values: */

console.log(set.values());

/* We can use a forEach or for-of loop on this to retrieve the values.
Interestingly, JavaScript tries to make Set compatible with Map. 
That's why we find two of the same methods as Map, keys() and entries().

As Set doesn't have keys,
the keys() method returns a SetIterator to retrieve its values: */

console.log(set.keys()); //same as set.values()
