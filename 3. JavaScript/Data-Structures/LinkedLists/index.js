/* 
Linked lists are a type of data structure 
that store values in the form of a list. 
Within the list, each value is considered a node, 
and each node is connected with the following value 
in the list (or null in case the element is the last in the list) through a pointer.

There are two kinds of linked lists, 
singly linked lists and doubly linked lists.
 Both work very similarly, 
 but the difference is in singly linked lists 
 each node has a single pointer that indicates the next node on the list. 
 While in doubly linked lists, each node has two pointers, 
 one pointing to the next node and another pointing to the previous node.
